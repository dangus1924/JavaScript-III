/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Window Binding is the Global context. It's when you call the function from the defualt window "consoloe.log(this)".
* 2. Implicit Binding would be the object standing before the dot
* 3. New Binding is when a object is created and referenced by "this" variable, inheriting the prototype of the function.
* 4. Expiicit Binding is when you force a function call to use a certain object for "this" binding without putting a property function reference on the object.
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
